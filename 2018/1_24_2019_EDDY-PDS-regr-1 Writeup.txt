I am using a simulated HR dataset from IBM. I created a subset for this assignment which includes variables representing Attrition (Yes or no), Department (Sales or Research), Job satisfaction rating, Satisfaction with work environment rating, and Distance from home in miles.

There was no signifigant relationship between the Attrition variable and the Department variable, phi = 0.0166, Chi-square(1, N = 1407)= 0.7432, p = .3886.

People who had a "Yes" value for the Attrition variable had signifigantly lower Job satisfaction, rpb = -0.108, t(1405) = -4.072, p < .001.

Distance from home and Satisfaction with work environment had no signifigant relationship, r(N = 1407) = 0.0199, p = 0.457, 95% CI [ -0.072, 0.0324].
