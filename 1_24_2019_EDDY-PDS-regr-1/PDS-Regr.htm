<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using your Personal Data Set (the one with two dichotomous 
variables and two continuous variables), do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<LI>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Compute the Pearson <I>r</i> between two of 
	the dichotomous variables.  This 
	<I>r</i> will be a <B>phi</b> coefficient. Square the phi coefficient and 
	the multiply it by the total number of subjects on which the phi was 
	computed. This will give you the Chi-square statistic that tests the null 
	hypothesis that the value of phi in the population is zero.&nbsp; Compare your computed value of Chi-square with that obtained when you computed Chi-square in the usual fashion for a contingency table analysis (as we did when we were covering the chapter on Chi-square).</li>
	<LI>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Compute the Pearson <I>r</i> between one of your dichotomous variables and one of your continuous variables.  This 
	<I>r</i> is a <B>point biserial</b> correlation coefficient.  Using the usual formula for computing the 
	<I>t</i> to test the null hypothesis that&nbsp;rho is zero, test the null hypothesis that the point biserial 
	correlation coefficient has a value of zero in the population. </li>
	<LI>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Compare your computed value of
	<I>t</i> with that obtained when you tested the relationship between the dichotomous variable and the continuous variable in the traditional way, with a pooled variances independent samples 
	<i>t</i>-test, like we did when we were covering Chapter 7.</li>
	<LI>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Conduct a correlation/regression analysis 
	predicting one of your continuous variables from another continuous 
	variable.  Start by evaluating the assumptions of the tests of significance 
	(normality and homoscedasticity).&nbsp; Obtain the correlation coefficient, 
	regression line, test of significance, and a
	<a href="http://vassarstats.net/rho.html">95% confidence interval for rho</a>.&nbsp; 
	Obtain a scatter plot with the regression line superimposed on the scatter 
	plot. Be prepared to write an APA-style report of the results should I call 
	on you to do so.</li>
	<LI>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">In the CorrRegrPDS forum in BlackBoard, write 
	a terse report on the results of your three analyses.&nbsp; For example,<ul>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Female college students were significantly 
		more likely to report having back problems than were male college 
		students, phi = .276, Chi-square(1, <i>N</i> = 100) = 7.605, <i>p</i> = 
		.006.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Men were significantly taller than were 
		women, <i>r<sub>pb</sub></i> = .806, <i>t</i>(153) = 16.836), <i>p</i> &lt; 
		.001.</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 6px">Faculty salaries were significantly 
		correlated with the number of years since they earned their Ph.D., <i>r</i>(<i>N</i> 
		= 397) = .419, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, 95% CI [.28, .54].</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later this semester you shall use these data to conduct an 
analysis of covariance, a factorial analysis of variance, and possibly some 
nonparametric or resampling statistics.</p>
